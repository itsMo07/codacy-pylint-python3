# logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203)
*Use %s formatting in logging functions* Used when a logging statement
has a call form of \"logging.\<logging method\>(f\"\...\")\".Use another
type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave
interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as
arguments. If logging-format-interpolation is disabled then you can use
str.format. If logging-not-lazy is disabled then you can use %
formatting as normal.
